# Welcome to Athena Triton

## Introduction
Welcome to Athena Triton, the innovative fusion of ATLAS's powerful Athena software package with the cutting-edge capabilities of the Triton Inference Server. ATLAS, one of the largest particle physics experiments at CERN, uses Athena to handle the vast data generated by particle collisions. Our platform enhances Athena by integrating remote inference capabilities through Triton, allowing for efficient, scalable, and high-performance processing of deep learning models. This enables advanced data analysis and machine learning applications, providing robust tools and flexible solutions for your computational needs.
